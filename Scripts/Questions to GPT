So on Google sheet we have these columns from A to H 
A Timestamp - shows time when google form data is inserted to the sheet
B Location
C Issue Category
D Issue Description
E Issue Solution
F Resolver
G Issue Log Time
H Issue resolve time

so what I want us to do is to sync all these into a card(trello) but in this creteria
since all these are columns, display each row on its card on list id 63c00d1b02ad370027927314 and list title "incoming"
# Set up Trello API credentials
TRELLO_KEY = 'de191ae0dcf871ec94a2c3a9e301f9ff'
TRELLO_TOKEN = 'ATTAa60e29643e75d864c757c0e614df0174ad436b9dbbbf7f99a36f9c51cf3799be0DD6667E'
BOARD_ID = '66c097ffa07e57790a36a234'
google sheet id we are pulling data from to trello is 
1hn-lNNq5mqSIVH4BvnFmTEdvbcFi7GzzSymGSxfxvII
google sheet name is "Form Responses 1"
GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_FILE = crested-trainer-292909-509d7f962395.json

further instructions are:
B to be the card title
the rest that A,C,D,E,F,G,H to be on the card description
Remember A to H are headings and data that needs to be fed on card starts from 
row 2 of the google sheet. so again make sure that data on each row will befed 
on its own card i.e data on row 2 on sheets to be fed on card 1, data on 
row 3 on sheets to be  fed on  card 2 and so on.


sudo systemctl status sync_sheet_to_trello.service


now I need to sync Trello board to Google sheet.
here are the objectives:
1. Sync List Titles to Columns.
2. Sync Cards  to Rows. Where by each card occupies each cell in each row
    under its list title on the column. Each card on acell sshould contain description, custom field if it is applicable, members assigned to the card,  due date, and checklist items, timestamps of how often the cards are moved around to different lists. Just neatly visualize these for future dashboard lookerstudio visualizations integration.
3. Make the titles a bit bold size 11
Apply all these on sheet 1.

Use this script but dont change anything that is on sheet 2
